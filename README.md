# Markup Constraints Extension

MarkupConstraints is a Slicer module to enable Slicer extension developers to constrain 
and synchronize markups and control points of different nodes. 

This extension was created during [Slicer Project Week 37][pw37] for the [Q3DC Extension][q3dc].

See the [Architecture Overview][arch] for details on the functionality and implementation 
of this module.
